 Natural Language Processing Project

 This is a machine learning model creation project to complete a class on Dicoding Indonesia, with the following targets:

1. The dataset has 3 classes or more and a minimum of 2000 data samples.
2. Must use LSTM in the model architecture.
3. Must use a sequential model.
4. The validation set is 20% of the total dataset.
5. Must use Embedding.
6. Must use a tokenizer function.
7. Accuracy on the training set and validation set above 90%.
8. Implement a callback.
9. Create plots for loss and accuracy during training and validation
